# QualtricsToTableau
A set of python script to reshape and pipe Qualtrics longitudinal survey results into a cleaned Tableau-ready format for data novices. I scripted for Political Science classes at Carleton College, MN, USA. Tableau and Qualtrics have GUI integration tools, but professors prefer to hand students semi-raw data for pedagogical purpose.
