# QualtricsToTableau
A set of python script to make Qualtrics survey output into clean data for Tableau novice to analyze. I scripted for Political Science classes at Carleton College. Tableau and Qualtrics have GUI integration tools, but professors prefer to hand students semi-raw data for pedagogical purpose.
